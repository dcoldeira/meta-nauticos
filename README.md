### **Yocto BSP layer for NauticOS.**  



**NauticOS** is a lightweight embedded linux Operating System made with the Yocto Project and BitBake aiming to optimize marine navegation softwares & hardwares to only include what is really needed onboard like the OpenCPN Chart Plotter Navigation, weather readers, SDR, sensor connections (air, SONAR, motor, exhaust, pressure, humidity, light, gas, smoke, batteries charge, tanks level, wind, switches etc), IoT and alike softwares and hardwares. It will be available for different architectures including but not limited to the Raspberry Pi boards. 

# **NauticOS needs:**. 
- This repo (the meta layer)
- NauticOS Desktop, the repo containing the desktop and GUI elements and 
- The Yocto image or build with all the recipes as per the SBC. 


*Builds are collection of layers (including this repo, meta-nauticos) baked and made with [The Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) aiming to useintegrate C++ and possibly [dart/flutter](https://github.com/meta-flutter/meta-flutter) too for embedding. Images will be available to download as soon as they are ready for production.* 


## **Currently working on the Raspberry Pi build.**
