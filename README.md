# NauticOS

#### An small OS for skippers, boaters and sailors targeting small single-board computers (SBCs) and the alike architectures.


NauticOS (pronounced Nauticos from latin nauticusâ€Ž, sailors) is aiming to optimize softwares for boaters and only include what is really needed onboard like the OpenCPN Chart Plotter Navigation and alike softwares. It will be available for different architectures including but not limited to the Raspberry Pis and the Arduinos boards (ideally it will run in something smaller that those).

- Currently working on the Raspberry Pi build (different architectures will be in different branches).

NauticOS is built with [The Yocto Project (YP)](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) and it is aiming to use the extraordinary [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) C++ library for the (bloat-free) graphical user interface (featuring SDL2 and openGLES, work in process though).

Images will be available as soon as they ready for production. **NauticOS is Open Source**  and if you think you can help, please get touch/involved/pull request your ideas etc.. More to come.
