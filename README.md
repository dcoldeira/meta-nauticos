# NauticOS

## An small OS for marine navegation softwares and harwares targeting small single-board computers (SBCs) and the alike architectures.


NauticOS is a small Operating System aiming to optimize marine navegation softwares and only include what is really needed onboard like the OpenCPN Chart Plotter Navigation, weather readers, SDR, sensor connections (air, SONAR, motor, exhaust, pressure, humidity, light, gas, smoke, batteries charge, tanks level, wind, switches etc), IoT and alike softwares and hardwares. It will be available for different architectures including but not limited to the Raspberry Pi and the Arduinos boards (ideally it will run on something smaller and even cheaper than those, hopefully). This project is a good starting point for **getting started with Embedded Linux systems.**


### NauticOS is built with [The Yocto Project ](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) as it's aiming to use Dart, Flutter and C++ for embeddeing.


## Builds 

**Currently working on the Raspberry Pi build**
