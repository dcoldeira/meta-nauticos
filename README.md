## **Yocto BSP layer for NauticOS.**  

----------------

**NauticOS** is a small Operating System aiming to optimize marine navegation softwares & hardwares to only include what is really needed onboard like the OpenCPN Chart Plotter Navigation, weather readers, SDR, sensor connections (air, SONAR, motor, exhaust, pressure, humidity, light, gas, smoke, batteries charge, tanks level, wind, switches etc), IoT and alike softwares and hardwares. It will be available for different architectures including but not limited to the Raspberry Pi and the Arduinos boards (ideally it will run on something smaller and even cheaper than those, hopefully). 

**NauticOS needs:**. 
- This repo, which is the desktop environment of NauticOS (that is the Desktop or GUI), and
- The image or builds of the Operative System

**NauticOS** builds are collection of [layers](https://doc.qt.io/QtForDeviceCreation/b2qt-how-to-create-b2qt-image.html) (including meta-nautics) baked and made with [The Yocto Project ](https://www.yoctoproject.org/)  aiming to use C++ for embeddeing. Images will be available to download as soon as they are ready for production. **Currently working on the Raspberry Pi build.**
