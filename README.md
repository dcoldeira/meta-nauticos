# NauticOS

## A small Operating System targeting small single-board computers (SBCs) for skippers, boaters and sailors.



#### NauticOS (pronounced Nauticos from latin nauticus, sailors) is aiming to optimize softwares for boaters and only include what is really needed onboard like the [OpenCPN Chart Plotter Navigation](https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN) and alike softwares. 

It will be available for different architectures including but not limited to the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino boards (ideally it will run in something smaller than those).


NauticOS is built with [The Yocto Project (YP)](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) and it is aiming to use the extraordinary [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) C++ library for the (bloat-free) graphical user interface and will be featuring SDL2 and openGLES (*work in process*).

Images will be available as soon as they ready for production. **NauticOS is Open Source**  and if you think you can help, please get in touch/involved/pull request your ideas etc.. *More to come.*

## Builds

**Different architectures will be in different branches.**

- Currently working on the Raspberry Pi build with the armv7l (32 bit) processor.
