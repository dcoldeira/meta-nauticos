# NauticOS

## An small OS for skippers, boaters and sailors targeting small single-board computers (SBCs) and the alike architectures.


NauticOS is aiming to optimize marine navegation softwares and only include what is really needed onboard like the OpenCPN Chart Plotter Navigation, weather readers, SDR, sensor connections (air, SONAR, motor, exhaust, pressure, humidity, light, gas, smoke, batteries charge, tanks level, wind, switches etc), IoT and alike softwares and hardwares. It will be available for different architectures including but not limited to the Raspberry Pi and the Arduinos boards (ideally it will run on something smaller and even cheaper than those, hopefully). This project is a good starting point for **getting started with Embedded Linux systems.**


### NauticOS is built with [The Yocto Project ](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) and [boot2qt](https://doc.qt.io/QtForDeviceCreation/b2qt-how-to-create-b2qt-image.html) as it's aiming to use C++ for embeddeing.

#### Images will be available to download as soon as they are ready for production. **NauticOS is Open Source**  and if you think you can help, please get touch/involved/pull request your ideas etc...

## Builds 

**Currently working on the [Raspberry Pi build](https://doc.qt.io/QtForDeviceCreation/b2qt-how-to-create-b2qt-image.html)**

## For people wanting to get involved in the project:

I have been working on the Raspberry Pi build, please take a look at the [RaspPi branch](https://github.com/dcoldeira/NauticOS/tree/RaspPi) and try and see if you can compile and build the image if you like but, **please be aware that this process can take very long time (days depending on your system)** so I would rather provide you a link once I am happy with the image so that you can download it and boot it on your Raspberry Pi and start the actual C++ development.

The potential is enormous, you can embed and develop any idea from sensors connections (i.e SONAR so you can enbed your own depth sounder) to IoT...
